/*
 * WORKER BEES HACKATHON
 * By Soham Panda, Aryan Anand, and Jason Carrasco
 * 3rd Period - A Day, AP Computer Science A
 * This class simulates the improvement process of a normal Worker Bee in the dystopian world of the Robot Overlords.
 * Users will be shown choices to choose from in order to keep their Worker Bee healthy, safe, and thriving.
 */
 
/*
 * NOTES:
 * Please be sure to replace the file path in the "getResources()" method with your own path aligned with BeeResources.dat!
 * "Thread.sleep()" and "System.exit(0) were used to pause and terminate the program at mandatory times."
 * All methods, classes, objects, variables, reference variables, and datatypes have been camel cased. [Ex: camelCase]
 * This java file is over 700 lines. 5 methods are boilerplated (repeated code with different "System.out.print" text) repeatedly.
 * All principles of object oriented programming were covered in this singular file: Abstraction, Ecnapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.

/* 
 * IMPORTS:
 * These are the required libraries needed to import to the WorkerBees class.
 * java.io.File - This is used to read files.
 * java.io.FileNotFoundException - This is used to throw file reader errors from file reader object.
 * java.util.InputMismatchException - This is used to throw input errors from scanner object.
 * java.lang.InterruptedException - This is used to throw program pausing errors.
 * java.util.Scanner - This is used to get user input.
 * java.lang.Math - This is used for using math functions such as rounding and randomization.
 * java.lang.Thread - This is used for pausing the program.

 * ABSTRACT CLASS BeeResources:
 * This class is used to set and get variables, objects, references, etc. for the program.
 * Doing this will be easier for methods to access any data or item in this file instead of returning.
 * This class is abstracted in order to not reveal any implementation methods to the user.
 * All reference variables are encapsulated and are set as protected in order to prevent a resource leak which an exception can't handle.
 * The "this." is to refer back to the variables as the object under the setter method "setResources()".
 * All other variables are getter methods and readers which get objects for cross-method usability.
 * Finally, they are returned for use. [Please note that they are not supposed to be "final" because these will be changed depending on user input]

/*
 * PUBLIC CLASS WorkerBees:
 * This class which defines this file is the main class that procceses inputs from the user and produces outputs to the user through logic and conditioning.
 * In order to use objects and variables, otherwise known as the resources for WorkerBees.java, we inherit abstract class BeeResources through an extension to public class WorkerBees.
 * Since our abstract class methods were not defined as static, it was exceptionally important to write instances for the WorkerBees Class in order to avoid an error of non-static presence.
 * The "getPassword()" method requires a simple, randomized PIN from the user. We use a while loop to loop through till the user has found the pin after a certain trial of tries of PIN codes.
 * The "getResources()" method uses the file reader object to the maximum. We gathered the data from the BeeResources.dat file in order to extract them into our 4 objects.
 * A scenario is given to the user for them to be informed and to know what the program is about.
 * The following methods: "ScenarioOne() {all the way through} SecnarioFive()" are five methods that used to ask questions to the user. Read the following for more elaboration.
 * Since these are boilerplate methods written from the "ScenarioOne()" method, it was simple to replace questions and answers with different things in order to increase variability.
 * For example, take any scenario method. This method will first give a situation that the user will face as a worker bee. They will need to answer the following question acoordingly.
 * Once answered, they will have percentages, integers, or points gaied or taken away depending on the answer choice they have chosen.
 * If any one of the objects reach 0% or go below that percentage level, the program will exit and tell the user that they have not saved their worker bee.
 * Boolean operations were used to determine when this percentage and when the end result (discussed in next line) is met including conditionals like "if/else/else if" and logical operators such as "||", "&&".
 * Finally, the last method "finalResult()" gives a result to the user if they have gone through all 5 scenario methods without getting a negative/zero percentage.
 * They will recieve either a bronze, silver, or a gold badge determining how high their percentages and levels are for their Worker Bee.
